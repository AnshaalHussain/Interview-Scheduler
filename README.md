# Interview Scheduler


One of my proudest projects coming out of Lighthouse Labs! It was while building this application that I grasped React concepts I was learning such as state management with the useState hook, passing props, data fetching with axios and useEffect, ...and much more.


The purpose of Interview Scheduler is to allow users to book appointments with a chosen day, time, and interviewer. When creating, edit or delete appointments, and the app will dynamically update and display the number of spots left in a day.

To run application

```bash
npm run start
```

To reset database

```bash
http://localhost:8001/api/debug/reset
```
